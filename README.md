The Supervised Driving Experience application is developed using PHP and MySQL, without any frameworks, ensuring full manual control over the backend. The database follows a normalized structure with multiple tables and relationships, including a many-to-many relationship for variables like weather conditions. The user interface is designed with HTML5 and CSS3, ensuring compliance with W3C standards and responsiveness via media queries and flexbox/grid layouts. Input forms include features such as default date and time, numeric keypads, and dropdowns for an enhanced user experience. Data storage and retrieval leverage prepared statements with PDO, prioritizing security against SQL injection. PHP sessions manage user sessions for state persistence, ensuring smooth navigation. The application supports filtering and sorting of driving records using JavaScript widgets and Chart.js for interactive graphs summarizing driving statistics. The application is deployed on Alwaysdata, enabling remote hosting and accessibility. All code is well-documented, and the database design includes an ER diagram demonstrating its scalability and optimization. This modular approach ensures maintainability and extensibility for future improvements.
